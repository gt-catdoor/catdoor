½” drill bits
Keyhole/scroll saw
Phillips screwdriver

INSTRUCTIONS

Step 1: Determine the pet door height. The distance between the bottom of the door and bottom of template should be 6”. Center the template (width) in the middle of the door and tape in place.

Step 2: With the template in place (A), draw around the edge of the template onto the door. Mark the corner holes with a nail or awl.

Step 3: Using the corner locations as your guide, drill four individual holes with a drill no longer than ½”.

Step 4: Starting on the inside of one of the drilled holes (B), cut just inside of the line using a keyhole or scroll saw.

Step 5: Insert the inner frame that contains the flap (C) into the opening from the interior side. Make sure that the frame is flush with the door surface. Caulking is recommended under the outer frame. Place the outer frame that does not contain the flap (D) into the opening from outside the door. Hold it in place and install the screws. Do not overtighten.

 

For Doors with Uneven Surfaces
After cutting the rough opening, build up the lowest areas with a wood frame thick enough to create an even door surface. Then proceed with the steps above.

For Walls:

Once the wall opening has been made, it is necessary to build a frame to cover the exposed area between the wall surfaces. When cutting through walls, use extreme caution and make sure not to cut any concealed wires, gas lines, or water pipes.

For Steel Doors:

Use a jigsaw with a hacksaw blade to cut the opening, starting at the pre-drilled corner holes. Then proceed with the steps above.
